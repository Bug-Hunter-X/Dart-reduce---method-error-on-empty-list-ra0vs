# Dart reduce() method error on empty list
This example demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce()` method requires at least one element in the list to perform the reduction operation. Attempting to use it on an empty list results in an error.

The solution involves checking if the list is empty before calling `reduce()`.  This prevents the error and makes the code more robust.
